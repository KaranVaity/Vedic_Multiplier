# Vedic Multiplier
* Prepared a program in Verilog and designed an 8 bit multiplier based on vedic mathematics
* Implemented the design based on Static CMOS in PSpice and verified the working of the circuit design

## Usage 
* Programmed the multiplier in verilog and prepared the testbenches for different multipliers
* Based on the verilog design, designed the circuits in PSpice whose files are located in [VLSI](./VLSI/) directory.
